In July 2018 **Jessica Labhart** [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-44849364) on the unusual numbers of taxi licences being granted in Wolverhampton, after taxi and private hire drivers protested in the city due to the massive rise in the number of licences issued by the city council.

Deregulation in 2015 allowed for drivers to work anywhere in England and Wales, regardless of where they have their licence. Wolverhampton cut the price of a licence and has gone from 852 private hire drivers in 2015 to well over 10,000 - the equivalent of one driver for every 24 people who live in the city.
